- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ManuelCapote


Iâ€™m a Self-taught Front End Web Developer, I love to build and create things, and I feel passionate about clean code and simple style, thus my love for Programming. I have strong experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as JavaScript frameworks like ReactJs and main CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and SemanticUi..
I am familiar with Design concepts and implementations, due to my past as Front End Dev and Designer for Cycle Limited. I have used tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD among others to implement UI/UX concepts on Websites, and always having Usability as one of the key principles. 
I have several years of experience as a Team Leader and Project Manager. For the past five years I have managed a team of 5 people, each of them in a different country, so I am very comfortable working remotely.
